This calculator was a challenge from the Cross-Platforms Professor. It is a very basic calculator, but it is intended to work exclusively by you pressing (clicking) buttons. A fully implemented calculator will behave exactly like a cheap store-bought calculator. I had to write all CSS and JavaScript in one html file.

Instructions:
•	Do not turn the display into an input field;

•	The display should start with a 0 when it is waiting for an initial value to be entered via the buttons. Pressing the C button (clear) will reset the calculator and should display a 0 in the .display element;

•	When the user clicks on any of the number keys the displayed value must be updated. If I have previously clicked a 9 then clicking a 3 should change the displayed number to 93;

•	When a user chooses any of the four operator keys (subtraction (-), division (/), multiplication (X), or addition(+)) then you will complete any previously started operation and display the result and your code will remember that the next number selected will start a new operand for our calculator;

•	Choosing the = key will complete the calculation, display the final value, and reset the calculator for the next equation without deleting the result until a new key is pressed. You cannot use the eval() function;

•	One other functionality is required, the dark mode button will toggle your calculator to a dark mode where the background is dark and the text light, this will also change the button text to light mode, which will revert to your original colour scheme;

•	Please do not add other buttons or functionalities to the calculator.
